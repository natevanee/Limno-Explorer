## A data aggregation visualization App. 

This App is a companion to my MS thesis on river nutrient loading and natural SRP buffering mechanisms for the Milwaukee and Sheboygan River's in Wisconsin.

It shows phosphorus fractionation data (e.g. dissolved, particulate, bioavailable, unavailable) as well as a suite of other ancillary data.
